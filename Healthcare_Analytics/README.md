# Research Project using Advanced Data Mining

**Model Building**

- [x] Predicting the High Utilization using Patients Claims.
- [x] Predicting the Mortality of ICU Patients.

**Optimize Hyperparameter Techniques**

- [x] Optimize hyperparameters for Random Forest & Logistic Regression For each of the method, search different hyperparameters.
- [x] For different values of lambda (C) in L1 regularized logistic regression.

**Local Sensitivity and Calibration Techniques**

- [x] Conduct sensitivity analysis for the testClaims data for predicting high utilization.
- [x] Select randomly two patients  test set. Conduct local sensitivity analysis for the prediction on these patients.

**Models built using Window Algorithm to predict ICU mortality using MIMIC**

- [x] Model that uses first 24 hours of data and predicts mortality any time (after 24 hours) during hospitalization. 
- [x] Model that uses 24-hour sliding window to predict morality at any time during hospitalization. 
- [x] Model that predicts mortality within 24 hours at any arbitrary point. 

**Neural Networks using Tensorflow**
- [x] Train and Test a neural network to predict high utilization in the next one year using recurrent neural networks

**Graph Database using Neo4j**
 - [x] Load hap780 data file on top of the MSHI database, to include all courses but also skills within hap 780. 
 - [x] Design appropriate relationships that need to be included to make the graph connected
